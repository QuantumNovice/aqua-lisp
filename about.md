## The code

This project came about as I started working on a different project
which I prototyped in Python but ultimately wanted to develop in
Lisp. In the prototype, I used several Python libraries for which I
either couldn't find a Lisp replacement, or the Lisp replacement was
terribly unmaintained.

After seeing all the complaints about Lisp's
["library problem"](http://ilc2009.scheming.org/node/8), I decided
that this was a deeper problem that I should work on.

## The author

I have been a Python coder since 2007, and have been hacking on
(Emacs) Lisp since shortly afterwards. Most of the projects I've
worked have been simply hobbies, so I have tended to favor Python's
libraries/readabity over Lisp's power. I am much more intimately
familiar with Python than Lisp, which hopefully puts me in a good
position to develop `py-lisp`.

## The blog

This website is hosted as a separate branch (`gh-pages`) of the GitHub
repo, making it available on `github.io` (where you are likely reading
it now).

The site itself is built using Jekyll on GitHub servers, which is an
awesome workflow. I write in Markdown and have "one-click" publishing
by pushing the files to the repo.

The awesome style of the site is provided by
[Pool](https://github.com/poole). This is the
[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme.
